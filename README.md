## Inspiration
Today, creating change in your community by setting legal precedence is much simpler than what it was even 25 years ago. But, the ability to create this change is still not fully democratized, or at least available in a platform that people who are not either interested in or a part of the profession can understand. With a growing number of problems having to be solved by the common people, a platform needs to exist to give someone the tools to try and set legal precedence without having to be a lawyer.
## What it does
Justify aims to solve that by providing a simply designed platform to create and collaborate on licenses for works, make and share petitions, as well as write articles for an online legal review that does not belong to a specific academic institution.
